Continuous-time Equalizer
=========================

Description
-----------
This example shows a continuous-time equalizer, widely used in a high-speed link receiver front-end. To make the simulation more realistic, a channel model in another example is preceding this equalizer.

Simulation
----------
1. go to ./sim directory
2. run Makerilf
   $ make
3. two eye-diagram are then saved
  - "ch_out.png" for channel's output
  - "eq_out.png" for equalizer's output
