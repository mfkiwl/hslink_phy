Channel model of a hs link
==========================

Description
-----------
This example shows a physical channel model for high-speed link. The channel is modeled using two complex poles/zeros (and their conjugates) and a single pole system.

Simulation
----------
1. go to ./sim directory
2. run Makerilf
   $ make
3. an eye-diagram is then saved to "ch_out.png"
