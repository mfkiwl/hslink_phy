- PMOS 65nm bulk
    Leff = 24.5nm     10%
    Vth = -0.18V    30mV
    Vdd = 1.1V
    Tox = 1.2nm
    Rdsw = 165nm 

- SCMOS settings:
    lambda = 32.5nm
    CAPMOD = 2
    PERMOD = 1 (PS/PD includes the gate perimeter)
    GEOMOD = 0 (default, no S/D shared or merged)

    DMCG (distance from S/D contact center to the gate edge) = 3 lambdas
    DMCI (distance from S/D contact center to the isolation edge in the channel-length direction) = 2 lambdas
    DMDG    (same as DMCG but for merged device only) = 1.5 lambdas
    DMCGT (DMCG of test structures) = 3 lambdas
    DWJ (offset of the S/D junction width) = 0
    XGW (distance from the gate contact to the channel edge) = 4 lambdas
    XGL (offset of the gate length due to variations in patterning)
